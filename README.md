# CardsPls
A tool to track who has already got a card buff. To prevent you from accidentally double-buffing those sneaky DPS's trying to keep all the buffs to themselves!

## Warning!
I created this plugin for personal use. It never was intended as a public plugin, so don't _**expect**_ any help or assistance if something doesn't work. But since quite a few people have since found their way to this plugin somehow, I figured I might as well write a readme.

## Installation guide
The installation guide can be found over on the page of my main repository:
